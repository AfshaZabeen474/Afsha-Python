Program Description: Sum of Elements in a List

This Python program calculates the sum of elements in a given list. It takes a list of numbers as input and returns the sum of all the elements in the list.

Algorithm:

1. Start by initializing a variable `total_sum` to 0, which will store the sum of elements.

2. Iterate through each element in the list using a loop.

3. Add each element to the `total_sum` variable.

4. After iterating through all the elements, the final value of `total_sum` will be the sum of all the elements in the list.

5. Finally, return the `total_sum` as the result.

Example usage:

Consider the following list: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

The sum of elements in this list is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15

This program provides a simple and efficient way to calculate the sum of elements in a list, making it useful for various tasks involving data manipulation, numerical analysis, and more. It can be easily incorporated into larger programs or used as a standalone utility.

Note: It's important to ensure that the input list contains only numerical elements; otherwise, the program may produce unexpected results or encounter errors. Additionally, if the list is empty, the program will return 0 as the sum.

Feel free to use and modify this program according to your requirements, and happy coding!
